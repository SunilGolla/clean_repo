Once you no longer need infrastructure, you may want to destroy it to reduce your security exposure and costs. For example, you may remove a production environment from service, or manage short-lived environments like build or testing systems. In addition to building and modifying infrastructure, Terraform can destroy or recreate the infrastructure it manages.
